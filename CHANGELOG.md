### Release 2024-03-08
* **AWS.Messaging (0.2.0-beta)**
  * BREAKING CHANGE: Message content is no longer included by default in logs or exceptions. Call `EnableDataMessageLogging` during setup to re-enable.
  * BREAKING CHANGE: Replaced `IsSQSExceptionFatal` with `IsExceptionFatal` to allow classifying a broader range of exceptions. Expanded the default list of fatal exceptions.
  * BREAKING CHANGE: Renamed `PublishAsync` to `SendAsync on the SQS-specific publisher, and create separate interface definitions to clarify "publishing" vs. "sending" depending on the destination service.
  * Allow overriding the destination and AWS service client on the service-specific publishers. This allows you to set the destination and credentials on a per-message basis, which may be useful for multi-tenant applications.
  * Improved validation on ECS task metadata when deriving the default value for the message source on ECS.
  * Improved documentation and examples around `IMessagePublisher`
